## Problem Domain
Create a method `palindrome?()` that takes in a string as an argument and determines whether that string is a palindrome. Output the input string with a return of `True` or `False` for the method.

### Example

* `palindrome?("racecar")` gives a boolean output of **true** because "racecar" is a palindrome.
* `palindrome?("flatiron")` gives a boolean output of **false** because "flatiron" is not a palindrome.

What would the output for the following strings be?
* `palindrome?("noon")`
* `palindrome?("five")`
* `palindrome?("radar")`
* `palindrome?("learnlovecode")`
